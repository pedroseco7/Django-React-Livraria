# Library Management System

A web-based Library Management System built with Django and React, designed to allow users to add and remove books from a digital library. This project serves as a foundational example of integrating a Django backend with a React frontend, creating a seamless user experience for managing books in a library.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Users can add new books by providing details such as title, author, release date, number of pages, genre, and an optional cover image.
- **Remove Books**: Users can delete books from the library.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: React provides a dynamic, responsive frontend for efficient library management.
- **REST API**: Django REST Framework powers the backend API for handling book-related operations.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database**: SQLite (default, can be configured for other databases like PostgreSQL)
